As this project comprises hardware software and documentation, it makes 
sense to apply an appropriate license to each part individually.

# Documentation

CC BY-SA 4.0

# Hardware

Applies to electronics and mechanics: CERN Open Hardware Licence v1.2

# Software/firmware

This is a bit involved, in all cases the more specific path applies. If 
a file specifies a license in the the header, this license shall 
prevail.
